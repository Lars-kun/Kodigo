{"notes": " Operating System Concepts covers the functions of operating systems, computer-system architecture, structure, operations, and storage management. An Operating System is a program that serves as an intermediary between a computer user and its hardware, with the primary goals of executing user programs, making problem-solving easier, making the computer system more convenient, and efficiently using the computer hardware. The computer system consists of four components hardware, which provides basic computing resources like CPU, memory, and I/O devices the operating system, which controls and coordinates hardware use among applications and users application programs, which define how system resources are used to solve user computing problems and users, including people, machines, and other computers.
