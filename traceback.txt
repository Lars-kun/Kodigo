I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

While running game code:
  File "game/script.rpy", line 521, in script
    friend_2 neutral_uniform "Yeah, let's hope for the best. Shall we go back?"
Exception: Say has image attributes ('neutral_uniform',), but there's no image tag associated with the speaking character.
